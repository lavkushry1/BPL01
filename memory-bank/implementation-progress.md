# Eventia Implementation Progress

## Current Status
The initial implementation of the Eventia event ticketing platform has been started with the main project structure in place. The following components have been implemented:

### Backend (eventia-backend-express)
1. **Project Structure** 
   - Set up main directory structure following the architecture document
   - Created the Express application structure with middleware and route registration
   - Set up database schema using Prisma ORM
   - Created the HTTP server with WebSocket support

2. **Authentication System**
   - Implemented authentication controller with register, login, refresh token, and logout routes
   - Added JWT token-based authentication with refresh tokens
   - Implemented rate limiting for login attempts
   - Set up validation schemas using Zod
   - Created password hashing using bcrypt

3. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Implemented API error handling with standardized response format
   - Created WebSocket service for real-time updates
   - Set up configuration system using environment variables
   - Added graceful shutdown handling

### Frontend (eventia-ticketing-flow1)
1. **Project Structure**
   - Set up main directory structure following the architecture document
   - Created React application with TypeScript
   - Set up routing with React Router
   - Added Tailwind CSS for styling

2. **Authentication System**
   - Implemented auth context provider for global authentication state
   - Created login page with form validation
   - Added API client with Axios for making requests
   - Implemented token refresh mechanism
   - Set up secure storage of auth tokens

3. **Internationalization**
   - Implemented language context provider with i18next
   - Added RTL support for right-to-left languages
   - Created language switching functionality
   - Set up persistent language preferences

## Next Steps
1. **Backend Development**
   - Implement event management controllers and routes
   - Add booking system with seat reservation
   - Create payment processing with UPI integration
   - Implement admin features for management

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Create event browsing and filtering components
   - Implement booking flow UI
   - Add seat selection components
   - Develop payment integration UI
   - Build admin dashboard

3. **Testing**
   - Set up test environment
   - Write unit tests for core functionality
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Implement end-to-end testing

4. **Deployment**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure production environment
   - Prepare Docker containers for deployment
   - Set up monitoring and logging

## Challenges and Solutions
- **API Path Configuration**: Fixed API endpoint path configuration by ensuring all routes use the `/api/v1` prefix consistently in both frontend and backend
- **Typescript Integration**: Addressed TypeScript errors by adding proper type definitions
- **Environment Setup**: Created configuration files with default fallbacks for development environment

## Progress Timeline
- **Day 1**: Set up project structure and core backend components
- **Day 2**: Implemented authentication system and API error handling
- **Day 3**: Created frontend structure and auth components
