# Build and Deployment Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the build and deployment process for the Eventia platform.

## Frontend Improvements

### 1. Build Optimization with Vite

The Vite configuration has been enhanced with:

- **Code Splitting**: Vendor libraries, UI components, and utilities are now split into separate chunks
- **Bundle Analysis**: Added a build:analyze script to visualize bundle size and composition
- **Cache Management**: Added content hashing for better browser caching
- **Index.html Cache-Busting**: Added dynamic build metadata to the index.html for proper cache invalidation
- **Sourcemap Control**: Only generating sourcemaps in development builds
- **CSS Optimization**: Enabled CSS code splitting for better performance

```bash
# Run the build with analysis
npm run build:analyze
```

### 2. Nginx Configuration

Improved Nginx configuration with:

- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**: Automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
- **SSL/TLS Optimization**: Using modern TLS protocols and ciphers
- **Security Headers**: Added security headers (HSTS, Content-Security-Policy, etc.)
- **Gzip Compression**: Enabled for text-based assets
- **Cache Control**: Optimized caching for different asset types
- **Security Headers Extraction**: Moved security headers to a separate file

### 3. Docker Configuration

Enhanced Docker configuration with:

- **Multi-stage Builds**: Reduced final image size and attack surface
- **Non-root User**: Running Nginx as a non-privileged user
- **Security Scanning**: Added automated vulnerability scanning
- **Build Arguments**: Better environment variable handling during build
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive container health monitoring
- **Certificate Validation**: Automatic certificate expiration checks
- **Dynamic Release ID**: Generated based on timestamp and git commit

### 4. Environment Variable Management

Improved environment variable handling with:

- **Environment Templates**: Created .env.template for consistent deployment
- **Build-time vs Runtime Variables**: Clear separation of build vs runtime variables
- **Secret Protection**: Enhanced protection of sensitive information
- **Environment Validation**: Added validation for required variables
- **Feature Flags**: Environment-based feature flag configuration

### 5. Security Enhancements

Added security improvements:

- **Dockerfile.prod**: Updated to include security scanning and hardening
- **.dockerignore**: Created to prevent sensitive files from being included in images
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Modern and secure SSL/TLS settings
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Added automated vulnerability scanning script
- **Certificate Validation**: Automatic monitoring of SSL certificate expiration
- **Non-root User**: Running containers with least privileges

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements

Improved CI/CD workflow with:

- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials generation for security tracking
- **Environment Template Processing**: Automated environment file generation
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrated into the deployment pipeline
- **Artifact Publishing**: Better artifact management and versioning
- **Deployment Automation**: Simplified and secure deployment process

### 7. Backup and Disaster Recovery

Added backup and recovery capabilities:

- **Volume Backup Script**: Automated Docker volume backups
- **Backup Rotation**: Configurable retention policy for backups
- **Secure Storage**: Proper permissions and encryption for backup data

## Backend Improvements

- **Environment Variables**: Better handling of environment variables in Docker
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Updated health check endpoint path for consistency

## Infrastructure as Code

[This section would contain the infrastructure as code improvements]

## Testing and Validation

- Added automated testing for the build and deployment process
- Implemented smoke tests after deployment
- Added health check validation

## Monitoring and Observability

- Enhanced logging for build and deployment processes
- Added performance monitoring for deployments
- Improved error tracking and reporting

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- [ ] Add canary deployments for feature testing
- [ ] Integrate performance testing into the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add automated security testing with OWASP ZAP
- [ ] Implement infrastructure as code with Terraform
- [ ] Add container resource limits and requests

## Usage Instructions

### Local Development

```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Run frontend with hot reload
cd eventia-ticketing-flow1
npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Manual deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Using GitHub Actions
# Push to main branch or use workflow_dispatch
```

### Backup Volumes

```bash
# Run backup script
./scripts/backup.sh
```

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Implement Blue-Green Deployments**: For zero-downtime updates
2. **Add Automated Database Backups**: Regular automated database dumps
3. **Implement Secrets Management**: Use a dedicated secrets management solution
4. **Add Performance Monitoring**: Integrate APM tools for real-time monitoring
5. **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
6. **Implement CDN Integration**: Add CDN configuration for static assets
